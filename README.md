MYGovDataSet
============

The aim of this project is to track the development of data.gov.my. The sort of functions envisioned include:

* Tracking viewcount trends - what datasets are popular?
* Tracking asset types - how quickly are we moving away from PDFs towards CSVs?
* Data custodian acticity - how often are data sets updated? Which ministries are actively pushing out more datasets?
