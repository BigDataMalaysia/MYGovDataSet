MYGovDataSet
============

**Note:** This project is not directly affiliated with the Malaysian government in any way.

The aim of this project is to track the development of [data.gov.my](http://data.gov.my). The sort of functions envisioned include:

* Tracking viewcount trends - Which datasets are popular?
* Tracking asset types - Are we moving away from PDFs towards CSVs?
* Data custodian activity - How often are data sets updated? Which ministries are actively pushing out more datasets?
